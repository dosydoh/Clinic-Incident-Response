Having identified the initial scope and potential source of the unusual network activity at the Clinic, now for the next crucial phases: Containment and Eradication. The primary objective is to prevent further damage and eliminate the threat from the environment.

Task
Short-term and Long-term Containment Plans: 
Short-term: Make a plan to Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage or spread of the malicious activity. This can be temporary until long-term solutions are in place.
Long-term: Make a plan Implement long-term measures such as system patches, firewall rules, or enhanced intrusion detection mechanisms to secure compromised systems.

While making plans, I will not be executing the plan. I will not be performing these actions, instead I'm  describing what will need to be done in response to this incident. In the plan, make sure to consider:
You've planned to back up the affected systems. This ensures you have a snapshot of the compromised environment.
You’ve planned to Identify any malware or malicious code, and document its behavior and characteristics.
You’ve planned to Identify and disabled any unauthorized or suspicious accounts.
You’ve planned to make recommendations on enhancing access controls and you have considered multi-factor authentication for sensitive systems or data.


Completed When:
You will know you are done when you have created a short-term plan, and you have created a separate long-term plan. The two plans work together to cover the considerations outlined above, as well as any other additional considerations you deem pertinent.
