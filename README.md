Incident response &amp; review

**** Clinic - Unusual Activity
Client has hired to come in as a security analyst on a team working for **** Clinic. **** Clinic, has a file transfer platform, recently flagged some unusual network activity that has raised alarms. The senior management is taking this incident very seriously, given the medical data contained on the network. As a contracting analyst for the Clinic, my job is to identify the nature of this alert, its potential impact, suggest mitigation strategies, and compile a review. To effectively complete the investigation I am collaborating with management and c-level execs to complete this project.
